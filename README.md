🚗 Exploratory Data Analysis on US Accident Data
This project involves an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a large-scale dataset of traffic accidents in the United States. The goal is to extract meaningful insights about accident patterns across time, location, and weather conditions, and to visualize these patterns clearly.

🔍 Key Highlights:
📅 Time Analysis:

Distribution of accidents by hour of the day, day of the week, and month

Focused visual analysis on Sundays and specific year (e.g., 2019)

📍 Location-Based Insights:

Accident hotspots mapped using Folium

Potential regional patterns in accident density

🌦️ Weather & Environmental Factors:

Analysis of accidents under different weather conditions (if available in data)

📊 Visualizations:

Used Seaborn, Matplotlib, and Folium for clear and interactive plots

Histograms, distribution plots, and maps to explore the data from multiple angles
